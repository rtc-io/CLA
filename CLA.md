# rtc.io Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”)

Thank you for your interest in the rtc.io open source Project which is being administered by National ICT Australia Limited (NICTA). This document describes the terms under which You, the person listed below, may contribute software, bug fixes, configuration changes, documentation, or any other materials that you send to Us related to the Project (each a “Contribution”) to the Project. This contributor license agreement (“Agreement”) documents the rights granted by You to Us with respect to your Contributions. Once agreed, these terms apply not only to your initial Contribution but also to all subsequent Contributions by You to the Project.

We appreciate your participation in our Project, and your help in improving the Project, so we want you to understand what will be done with the Contributions. This license is for your protection as well as the protection of NICTA and its licensees. It does not change your right to use your own Contribution for any other purpose.

If you agree to be bound by the terms of this license, then please complete the following information about you and the Contribution and sign electronically.

_This is a legally binding license agreement, so please read it carefully before you decide whether to agree to it._

If you have questions about these terms, please contact Us at silvia.pfeiffer@nicta.com.au.

## In this Agreement:

“Us”, “We” and “NICTA” means National ICT Australia Limited (ABN 62 102 206 173) a company registered in Australia with its registered office at Level 5, 13 Garden Street, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia. NICTA originated and administers the rtc.io Project.

“You” means you, the Contributor.

“Project” means any repository in the rtc.io open source GitHub organisation rtc-io (at https://github.com/rtc-io/).


## Corporate/ Institutional Contributions:

It is important to understand whether You personally own all intellectual property rights in your Contribution or whether, (if you do not own all those intellectual property rights), You are authorised to enter into this license on behalf of the entity which does own those rights.

If some third party (like your employer, or perhaps your university) may claim rights in Your Contribution, then it is likely that they must authorise You to grant this license. Alternatively, You must arrange for a person who is authorised on behalf of the owner of the intellectual property rights to execute this license on behalf of that third party owner of the intellectual property rights.

## If you are certain that:

1. You (personally) own all intellectual property rights in your Contribution; or
2. You are authorised on behalf of the corporate or institutional owner of all intellectual property rights in your Contribution, then please proceed to read the following license.

## You and NICTA agree:

1. You grant to Us the ability to use the Contributions in any way. You hereby grant to NICTA, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, sub-licenseable, transferable license under all of Your relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, and any other rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute and publicly perform and display the Contributions on any licensing terms, including without limitation: (a) open source licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL), the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), the Common Public License, the Apache License, or the Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD); and (b) binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses. Except for the licenses granted herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Contributions.

2. You are able to grant Us these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer or another third party has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission and are authorised to make the Contributions and enter into all the terms of this license on behalf of that employer or third party.

3. The Contributions are your original work. You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship which you have not copied from any third party and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in the copyright to the Contributions and any invention or patent related to the Contributions. You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license.

4. We determine the code that is in our Project. You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any Project or source repository is entirely NICTA’s. This agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.

5. No Implied Warranties. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, NICTA acknowledges that Your Contribution is provided “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

6. Moral Rights. If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.

7. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New South Wales, Australia. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (“UN Convention”) and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.

8. This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us with respect to Your Contributions and overrides all other agreements or understandings.

9. If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party then, as a condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and obligations in the Agreement.

10. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.

11. If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, that provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy, to the maximum extent possible under law.
